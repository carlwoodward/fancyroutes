Fancyroutes
===========

Fancyroutes is the first project from the TRED team. It has the following goals:

* Clean up route files
* Forget about rest out of the box (It's an API, build it as one)
* Provide building routes functionality
* Provide route linking functionality

Put your fancy routes into your routes file.

Example
=======

FancyRoutes::RouteSet.new(@map) do
  (get / 'orders' >> :orders > 'index')
  (with / :slug >> :my_controller).match do
    (get / 'order' > :my_action).create
    (post / 'order' > :my_action).create
  end
  (get / {'item_images' => :controller} / :image > :show).create
end
